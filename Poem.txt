violets are blue
poems should rhyme
but this one does not
hawaii is nice
palm trees are tall
taco bell is yum
year twenty twenty
everything changed
first was Kobe
helicopter not tamed
covid is here
quarantined for real
yet the worst is still coming
spring semester will begin

roses are red

taco bell is yum
year twenty twenty
everything changed
first was Kobe
helicopter not tamed
